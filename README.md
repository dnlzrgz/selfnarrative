# SelfNarrative - A Personal Data Journey

Since March 11, 2020, I've been consistently maintaining a diary in which I have been documenting what I did, how the day unfolded and how I felt. Over time, as I continued this daily habit, curiosity crept in and I started wondering about what my diary could reveal about me. Was I happier in the past, or am I happier now? How many bad days have I had? How many good days?  
In this repository I plan to answer those questions and to gain some insights about myself and my life.
